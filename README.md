The `check-versions` crate is a simple crate that will help you
remember to update the versions numbers in your `README.md` file.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
check-versions = "0.1"
```

Then create a `tests/check-versions.rs` with:
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate check_versions;

#[test]
fn test_readme_deps() {
    assert_markdown_deps_updated!("README.md");
}
```

This test will ensure that the dependencies mentioned in your
`README.md` file is kept in sync with your crate version:
```
$ cargo test --test check-versions -- --nocapture
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/check_versions-3b40b9d452dd9385

running 1 test
Checking code blocks in README.md...
README.md (line 10) ... ok
test test_readme_deps ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

Here the `README.md` file still references version 0.1.0, while the
version number in `Cargo.toml` has been changed to 0.2.0. The test
fails and the code block with the error is shown:

```
$ cargo test --test check-versions -- --nocapture
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/check_versions-8fbc5f3b97f4ec3a

    check-versions = "0.1"
